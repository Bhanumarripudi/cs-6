# Low-Level Requirements (LLRs)
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect and preprocess sEMG signals, including noise filtering, segmentation, and normalization.
   - Convert raw sEMG signals into formats suitable for CNN input.

2. **Model Design and Training**:
   - Implement a CNN architecture with an attention mechanism to focus on critical features in the sEMG signals.
   - Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization.

3. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Apply transfer learning techniques to adapt the model to new gestures or users efficiently.

4. **Real-Time Testing**:
   - Test the system in real-time to ensure low latency and reliable performance in gesture recognition.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Measure classification accuracy, response time, and robustness under varying conditions.
   - Compare performance with and without the attention mechanism.

6. **Hardware Considerations**:
   - Ensure compatibility with low-power devices by balancing model complexity and computational resource requirements.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement mechanisms to handle errors in gesture recognition, especially for similar gestures.

8. **Scalability**:
   - Design the system to support additional gestures or integration with other sensor types like accelerometers in the future.
